These are some basic projects build with Opencv.

#First project is a Object Detection Algorithm that identifies
objects in a Image using YOLO Algorithm.

#Second project is our schooltime favourite tictactoe game build 
with opencv.

#Third project is a object avoiding and type counting bot, it counts 
whether the object avoided was sphere kind or cuboid kind of object.
